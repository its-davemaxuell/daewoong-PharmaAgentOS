# PharmaAgent OS

An evidence-first research and review workspace. Home starts with an employee's
objective; the FDA Research Agent produces a cited brief, while Ask AI supports
quick questions. Saved conversations, research tasks and personal drafts can be
resumed from Home. Public browsing requires no account. Formal team decisions
remain version-bound and require authorized reviewers.

An evidence-first internal service for monitoring U.S. FDA warning letters whose
canonical FDA metadata contains the exact product class `Drugs`. The platform
keeps official source evidence authoritative, versions every source and derived
artifact, and prevents unverified or non-Drug records from entering search or RAG.

This repository implements the production handover in
`FDA_Drug_Warning_Letter_Intelligence_Platform_Industrial_Handover_v2.md`.
The consolidated product experience and release acceptance contract lives in
`docs/product/UX_SPEC.md`; it is the source of truth for current interface behavior.
The complete feature, interface, backend-pipeline, operations, and current-state
handoff is maintained in [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md).

The additive PharmaAgent OS implementation baseline is defined by
[`docs/product/PHARMA_AGENT_OS_SPEC.md`](docs/product/PHARMA_AGENT_OS_SPEC.md),
with its intended-use boundary and staged architecture under `docs/assurance/`
and `docs/architecture/agent-platform.md`. The complete implementation inventory,
verification evidence, migration order, and operations handoff are in
[`PHARMA_AGENT_OS_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md`](PHARMA_AGENT_OS_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md).

Deployment status and the remaining launch blockers are recorded in
the [2026-09-06 readiness audit](docs/assurance/launch-readiness-20260906.md).
Passing local tests does not constitute production release approval.

## What is implemented

- FastAPI service with deterministic Product scope decisions, immutable source
  versions, lifecycle events, evidence anchors, review state, audit events, and
  authorization-aware retrieval.
- FDA acquisition controls including host and IP validation, redirect limits,
  response bounds, `robots.txt`, crawl-delay enforcement, and FDA's server-side
  DataTables JSON/HTML listing discovery. Discovery/backfill uses a configurable
  three-year window, while an
  auditable five-year soft-retirement gate keeps aged letters out of active search
  and RAG without deleting retained source evidence.
- Automatic, idempotent NEW/UPDATED email outbox delivery with an admin-editable
  target. SMTP is disabled locally until an approved provider is explicitly
  configured, so tests and fixture ingestion cannot send real mail.
- Next.js portal with a research-first Home, source-grounded chat, a server-paginated
  Drug Letter Explorer, evidence detail, trends, saved views,
  review, and operations administration. Each detail view can persist a validated
  Korean full-letter translation, structured findings, and a practical summary
  against the exact retained FDA source version, then open a letter-constrained
  chat with those saved artifacts available as non-authoritative context. The
  entire application chrome and workflow UI can be switched between English and
  Korean; official FDA source text remains authoritative.
- Account-free public browsing with isolated anonymous browser sessions and
  owner-scoped persistent chat history. Public visitors have viewer permissions;
  privileged review and administration remain protected.
- Agentic retrieval routing that skips document search for greetings/help, uses
  structured metadata for dates/links/counts, locks dossier questions and
  follow-ups to selected-letter chunks, and reserves corpus search for broad
  discovery. Users can select Fast/Balanced/Deep or let Auto choose an approved
  model profile for the request.
- Versioned chunk embeddings suitable for managed PostgreSQL + pgvector, with
  lexical fallback and a resumable existing-corpus embedding backfill.
- Daewoong Pharmaceutical visual identity using the current official logo,
  navy/cobalt palette with a restrained orange brand accent, and locally hosted Pretendard variable font. The font
  license is retained beside the asset in `apps/web/app/fonts`.
- PostgreSQL/pgvector reference schema, strict AI summary JSON Schema, versioned
  pharmaceutical taxonomy, and OpenAPI 3.1 contract.
- PharmaAgent OS Milestones 0–8: governed cases and plans; 5 versioned agents,
  10 skills, and 16 deny-by-default tools across 3 private MCP bundles; bounded
  LangGraph execution inside an optional Temporal outer workflow; ACL-first
  synthetic internal knowledge and impact hypotheses; independent verification,
  immutable QA-reviewed artifacts, and export; multi-trial evaluation and release
  gates; Control Tower telemetry and kill switches; and draft/read-only Email,
  Slack/Teams, Notion/task, document-metadata, and answer-only A2A integration.
- Local infrastructure definitions, security policies, threat model, runbooks,
  and CI quality/security gates.

## Local development

### 1. Optional local data services

The API defaults to SQLite and local immutable objects, so these services are not
required for the first run. To exercise the deployment-shaped dependencies:

```powershell
Copy-Item infra/local/.env.example infra/local/.env
# Replace the local-only password placeholders before starting the stack.
docker compose --env-file infra/local/.env -f infra/local/compose.yaml up -d --wait
```

This starts loopback-only PostgreSQL/pgvector, authenticated Redis, and versioned
MinIO. See `infra/local/README.md` for lifecycle and data-removal cautions.

### 2. API

```powershell
cd services/api
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m app.cli init-db
python -m app.cli seed-demo
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Development API calls use explicit identity headers:

```text
X-Dev-User: local.user
X-Dev-Roles: viewer
```

Use `reviewer` or `admin` only for the matching local workflow. Development
header authentication cannot start in production mode.

Optional grounded AI answers use an allowlisted Gemini profile. Keep the credential only
in `services/api/.env` (which is ignored), set `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini`,
`GEMINI_API_KEY`, and the `CHAT_*_MODEL_ID` values from `.env.example`, then restart the API.
`auto` routes low-latency single-letter work to Fast, broad/multi-letter work to
Balanced, and internal workflow comparison support to Deep. Enable semantic
retrieval separately with `EMBEDDING_ENABLED=true`; its model and 1,536-dimensional
vector space are independent of the selected chat model.
Persisted document translation and analysis use their separately configured
`DOCUMENT_*` model profile with strict structured-output and source-integrity
validation. See `services/api/README.md` for the grounding and
production-approval boundary.

### 3. Portal

In a second terminal:

```powershell
cd apps/web
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. If the API is unavailable, the portal visibly
switches to its isolated preview dataset; it never presents preview data as live.
The main chat fails closed and displays a connection error instead of substituting
a canned answer when grounded retrieval is unavailable.
Use the `EN` / `한국어` control in the portal header to change the interface
language. The preference is retained in the browser.

The portal opens directly without login or provider accounts. Configure
`PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET` for anonymous browser isolation and the API-session RSA
settings in `apps/web/.env.example` for the private backend connection. Public
visitors receive viewer authority; approval and administration remain controlled.
See `docs/runbooks/authentication.md` for setup and verification.

After installing the API and portal dependencies, Windows users can start both
services as persistent hidden local processes from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-local.ps1
```

The launcher creates and seeds its isolated local database on first use. Stop only
the processes recorded by that launcher with `scripts\stop-local.ps1`.

### 4. Quality checks

```powershell
cd services/api
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check app tests
.\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe

cd ../../apps/web
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Contract and deployment validation commands are documented alongside the files
under `contracts/` and `infra/`. The current non-secret Railway staging map is in
[`infra/deployment/railway/README.md`](infra/deployment/railway/README.md).

To exercise deployment-spanning agent runs, start the optional Compose
`agent-platform` profile and run `pharma-temporal-worker` from the API virtual
environment. The database ledger remains authoritative and the database queue is
the safe fallback when Temporal is disabled.

## Safety boundaries

- Corpus admission is deterministic. AI never decides Product scope.
- `UNVERIFIED`, `AMBIGUOUS`, and `OUT_OF_SCOPE` content cannot enter user search
  or retrieval.
- FDA HTML and attachments are untrusted input and are never rendered raw.
- Authorization and corpus filters are applied before lexical/vector retrieval.
- Generated answers must cite stored official-source anchors and report when
  evidence is insufficient.
- The service is regulatory intelligence and human decision support. It does not
  initiate CAPA, declare an internal compliance gap, or replace controlled quality
  records.

## Production handoff

The included deployment material is a baseline, not approval to bypass Daewoong
controls. Before backend production activation, configure the server assertion boundary and
replace local storage and example endpoints with approved private managed services, KMS/secrets,
SIEM, enterprise AI gateway, backup/restore, and notification integrations. All
release-blocking controls in `SECURITY_CONTROL_MATRIX.md` still require recorded
verification evidence.

The same SQLAlchemy runtime can use SQLite locally or a managed PostgreSQL
`DATABASE_URL`; PostgreSQL stores approved chunk vectors with pgvector. Raw source
objects use the local filesystem during development and the implemented private
S3-compatible immutable adapter in cloud environments. Production rollout still
requires controlled database migrations/bootstrap, managed bucket provisioning,
plus an exercised data migration and restore procedure.

## UI audit implementation (10 September 2026)

See [the implementation and qualification record](docs/assurance/ui-audit-20260910.md)
for the audit-to-code mapping, checks, deployment order and remaining manual checks.
The authoritative source plan is `PHARMA_AGENT_OS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`; current
implementation status is `PHARMA_AGENT_OS_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md`.

Conversations, research tasks and bookmarks belong to a non-renewing, 30-day
anonymous browser session. Clearing cookies or expiry may remove access without
deleting stored records. Export important work before expiry. Personal review
drafts use local browser storage; they are not submitted team review records.
The interface explains these differences on the relevant save surfaces.

Run the deterministic Chromium/Firefox/WebKit suite after building the web app:

```powershell
cd apps/web
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
npm run build
npm run test:browser
```

Browser tests start an isolated loopback fixture API and use fictional records.
They do not call production, generate model answers or send messages. CI attaches
traces, screenshots and route network measurements to the tested commit.
