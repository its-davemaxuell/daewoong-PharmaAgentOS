# PharmaAgent OS implementation handoff

**Handoff date:** 2026-09-09

**Next engineer:** Start with [the transfer brief](NEXT_ENGINEER_HANDOFF.md) for
the publication state, production blockers, verification and ordered
next steps. This file remains the authoritative implementation record.

**Authoritative workspace:** `C:\Users\user\Desktop\PharmaAgentOS`  
**Source plan:** `PHARMA_AGENT_OS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`  
**Implementation state:** Milestones 0–8 have reference implementations; production qualification is incomplete.

**2026-09-09 new-account database migration:** Imported the local `data.sql`
application dataset into Supabase project `iqevzrztpdiysnojzpur` through its
session pooler. The empty public schema received 59 current application tables,
controlled migrations and runtime-role policies. All 21 exported application
table counts were checked again after commit: 884 warning letters, 886 documents,
884 document versions and 4,298 chunks, plus the exported related records.
All 59 tables have RLS enabled; anon/authenticated have no table SELECT grants.
Evidence: `.artifacts/migration-iqevzrztpdiysnojzpur/database-copy-result.json`.
All 444 source files (20,454,044 bytes) are now uploaded to the new project's
private `pharma-evidence` bucket. Every file was downloaded again and matched
its expected SHA-256 checksum. Storage evidence is recorded in
`.artifacts/migration-iqevzrztpdiysnojzpur/storage-copy-result.json`.
Supabase-managed auth/storage SQL was not restored. The old projects were not
modified. The user supplied the existing OpenAI key; model access was verified
and it is configured only in the new Railway API and worker services.
New-account access is verified for `davemaxuellkr@gmail.com` in both providers.
Vercel credentials are isolated in `.artifacts/vercel-new-account`; CLI commands
also use `--scope davemaxuellkr-9654`. The root `.vercel` project link now selects
the new project; its previous metadata is backed up in ignored migration artifacts.
The new Vercel project `pharmaagent-os` is deployed at
https://pharmaagent-os-ochre.vercel.app (deployment
`dpl_6P3HBh1TcsSkMi8vzjXM5pYwAiUU`). Railway target is project
`ee39ef7f-694b-4ddb-b1c7-6cdbc078974b`, environment
`00fa2021-eaec-47ea-abc1-839572451872`, API service
`42a7b375-3b14-4563-bf06-8da4a946a43b`, with worker service
`7685b37a-a658-4452-9769-f8dde80a7e13`. Both services are running. API readiness
at https://daewoong-pharmaagentos-pharmaagentos.up.railway.app/health/ready
returns HTTP 200 with database/object-store checks `ok`. The worker started
scheduled ingestion and successfully fetched FDA robots/listing/table endpoints.
Dedicated API/worker database login roles are created and verified to read all
884 letters without owner/bypass-RLS privileges. Their credentials and new
application signing/session credentials are in ignored migration artifacts.
The new Vercel frontend uses root directory `apps/web`, the Railway API origin,
polling research-worker mode, and newly generated signing/session credentials.
Hosted browser checks load the live library (440 records in the default drug-only
filter) and a document detail. An end-to-end research request progressed through
planning/searching/reading/checking and completed with a saved result (five model
calls, 15 events). A real Korean chat request returned HTTP 200 and rendered a
`gpt-5-mini` answer with linked Safrel source citations. Evidence
is under `.artifacts/migration-iqevzrztpdiysnojzpur/`.
Vercel Git auto-deployment remains pending: `vercel git connect` was rejected
because the new Vercel account lacks a GitHub login connection. The user has
been asked to connect `its-davemaxuell` in Vercel account settings. Railway API
and worker already use the new GitHub repository. No supplied secrets were
found in tracked or unignored files.

**2026-09-09 Railway import correction:** The new repository is
`its-davemaxuell/daewoong-PharmaAgentOS`. A root `Dockerfile` now mirrors the API
Dockerfile so Railway imports select Python instead of the root Supabase npm
tooling. CI enforces equality and builds the root runtime image. The setup guide
includes recovery from Railpack's missing start command error. Local file parity
and diff checks passed; a local container build was unavailable because the
Docker daemon was stopped. Railway deployment and readiness remain unverified.

**2026-09-09 Railway backend preparation:** The backend now supports Railway API
and persistent ingestion/research worker services using the existing Supabase
database and storage. Daily incremental FDA collection, checkpoint recovery,
single active ingestion claims, strict pagination checks and a read-only live
FDA diagnostic are implemented. The Vercel website has an optional external API
origin and polling-worker setting. Follow [RAILWAY_SETUP.md](RAILWAY_SETUP.md)
and [qualification evidence](docs/assurance/railway-20260909.md). The user will
deploy Railway from GitHub; Railway resources, production routing and existing
Supabase schedules are unchanged. Preserve root package files and `supabase/`.

Application revision `386d753` is pushed and its Vercel deployment is healthy.
All GitHub quality/security jobs pass, including PostgreSQL scheduling/claim
concurrency and both containers. Local verification passed 574 backend tests,
50 frontend tests, production build and live FDA pagination/detail ingestion.
The remaining step is the user's Railway deployment and subsequent website
cutover using the prepared guide.

**2026-09-09 visual simplification:** Home and Help use a shared three-step visual
journey, short task rows and expandable scope/storage notes. Research has a compact
journey, stage/action icons, the latest four actions with full-history disclosure,
and collapsed plans/review notes. Chat and sidebar introductory copy is shorter.
Generated findings, citations, questions, exports and all runtime behavior remain
intact. See [visual UX evidence](docs/assurance/visual-ux-20260909.md) for verification
and current publication status. Preserve the user's root package files and `supabase/`.

Application revision `2eec5f7` is hosted. The preceding UI release passed all GitHub
jobs, 32 hosted bilingual/viewport checks and a real Korean research brief in 25.5
seconds. Four recent actions expand to the full history; keyboard disclosure,
citations, exports, saved-task reload and browser ownership checks pass. The final
active-stage icon correction also passes its hosted browser state check. Current
CI links and release evidence are maintained in the visual UX record.

**2026-09-08 FDA Research Agent:** A bounded goal-driven research workflow is
deployed at `/research`. OpenAI chooses native plan/search/read/submit tools;
source integrity and a separate AI evidence check gate a saved human-review brief.
Supabase persists browser-owned tasks, private checkpoints and public execution
events. The interface shows actual live actions, plan and source passages, with
Stop/Resume, View brief and export. Research has a separately enabled background
worker lane and active conditional one-minute recovery schedule. Real Korean and
English OpenAI briefs, live progress, browser isolation, and Stop/Resume completing
after all browser pages close are verified. New tables deny browser
and general read-only database roles. Existing internal specialist/approval and
FDA ingestion execution remain unqualified/disabled. See
[research qualification](docs/assurance/research-agent-20260908.md) for local and
hosted evidence. Preserve the user's untracked root package files and `supabase/`.

Release `e0f8c28` is deployed and all GitHub checks pass: 551 backend tests,
46 frontend tests, PostgreSQL/RLS/concurrency, Temporal and container/security
checks. The final Korean hosted brief completed in 23.1 seconds with two sources;
the complete browser journey and background Stop/Resume passed without errors.

**2026-09-08 loading performance:** Sidebar history/notifications now load after
the page renders, with private authenticated responses and retry without a page
reload. Late history reads preserve locally created, edited and archived chats.
A bounded SQL-paginated metadata catalog replaces five sequential collection
requests for the current 440 visible letters. Document/history links avoid bulk
prefetching. Letter detail shares its request between metadata and rendering and
uses the version/hash already returned with its content. Vercel is confirmed in
Sydney alongside the database. Local build, lint, 38 frontend tests, 55 focused
API checks, two OpenAPI checks and contract validation passed.
A delayed-sidebar browser check rendered Home in 688 ms while the sidebar remained
pending for three seconds; loading, failure/retry and history hydration passed.
Final application revision `489214b` passed all GitHub quality/security checks.
The preceding performance release passed hosted smoke: 440
letters, a real AI answer with six citations, saved history after reload, session
isolation and healthy database/storage. Final repeat navigation improved Home
3.855 → 0.600 s, chat 24.495 → 0.711 s and library 24.576 → 0.848 s. Letter detail
improved 10.645 → 2.336 s. All 16 final hosted navigations returned 200 without
browser errors. Before/after evidence is recorded in
[performance evidence](docs/assurance/performance-20260908.md).

**2026-09-08 beginner AI experience:** Home now leads to the working AI through
one primary action and three editable example tasks. Chat uses automatic defaults,
a visible question label and text send/stop buttons; model, scope and filters are
optional. Progress/errors and the help guide use plain Korean/English. The guide
accurately distinguishes saved FDA data and cited AI answers from future ingestion
and specialist/internal-document execution.

The complete existing draft workflow moved to `/requests`, retaining storage keys
and redirecting old `/dashboard#saved-requests` bookmarks. Navigation has five
everyday destinations, with drafts also linked directly from Home. Specialist and
operational routes retain their access guards. Production build/TypeScript, lint,
26 frontend tests and 26 browser checks passed, covering both languages at
320/390/768/1440px, example prefill without auto-send, advanced controls, keyboard
focus and draft recovery. No JavaScript errors or horizontal overflow. The design
detector found only existing rules in legacy global CSS, none in new UI code.
Evidence: `.artifacts/beginner-ux-20260908/`. Revision `81f3e9b` deployed and passed
GitHub quality/security and all 26 hosted browser checks. A generic Korean example
returned six sources through the source-only fallback, not an AI explanation.
The follow-up UX explains that state and keeps long raw excerpts closed until
requested. Three regression checks bring the passing frontend total to 29.
Final application revision `d25d5cb` is deployed. A hosted Korean document-specific
question completed with a `gpt-5-mini` explanation and six cited sources; no browser
errors. Database and Storage readiness remain healthy. See
[beginner UX evidence](docs/assurance/beginner-ux-20260908.md).

**2026-09-08 hosted data and AI verified:** Production revision `7956f26` passed
GitHub quality/security checks. Both public health endpoints return 200; database
and Storage checks are healthy. A live browser displayed 440 active drug letters,
opened the source detail and completed a Korean OpenAI answer with six citations.
Four additional drug-scope rows are retired illustrative fixtures and stay hidden.
The explicit private Vercel API hostname is admitted, and general backend reads
now allow 15 seconds instead of 3.5 seconds. Temporary provisioning credentials
were removed; the copied data and original source export remain preserved.
This supersedes earlier missing-database notices. Full specialist execution,
scheduled ingestion and the home page's local-draft workflow remain separate work.

**2026-09-08 dataset copy completed:** The owner approved destination
`wdaflyddglimtijvgazl`. All source application records were copied transactionally;
884 letters and 4,298 chunks match the dump. All 444 raw source files passed
source/destination SHA-256 verification. The destination now has all 57 current
tables, the full migration sequence, RLS boundary and separate runtime logins.
Production Vercel credentials/settings are provisioned. An explicit managed
Vercel request-logging mode supports this hosting configuration without a dummy
OTLP endpoint. See [copy evidence](docs/assurance/dataset-copy-20260908.md).
Hosted end-to-end verification is complete as recorded above.

**2026-09-08 populated dataset located:** The owner supplied `data.sql`, a data-only
export with 884 letters (444 in-scope drug letters), 4,298 passages and 444 Storage
object metadata rows. Read-only queries against the now-linked Supabase project
`uwgzvobkblrnmqwroegh` (`supabase-daewoong`) matched those counts. Earlier empty
results concerned two different projects. Existing exported table columns match;
36 Agent OS tables are absent. Database destination selection is pending before
cloud changes. See [dataset evidence](docs/assurance/dataset-discovery-20260908.md).
The dump is preserved and Git-ignored; it includes historical chat records.

**2026-09-08 OpenAI activation:** Added a server-only Responses provider with
shared citation/language checks, structured analysis and Korean translation.
The supplied key passed real adapter calls using synthetic evidence. Production
and Preview now hold `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a Vercel Secret and select `gpt-5-mini`
for generation, with empty document fallback lists. Embeddings remain disabled.
The temporary key file was removed; no repository secret matches were found.
See [activation evidence](docs/assurance/openai-activation-20260908.md) for test
scope. Database, storage, corpus and full agent-workflow activation remain pending;
the home request form still saves local drafts.

**2026-09-08 employee usability redesign:** Replaced the workflow-first home with
a guided review request: select one of three plain-language tasks, write an
editable question using an optional example, add an optional FDA HTTPS link,
and save or download the request. Up to 30 browser drafts can be reopened,
updated and deleted with confirmation. The earlier single-draft format migrates
without losing content. Readable text export is primary; labeled JSON remains
available in technical details. Browser storage failures retain editor contents
and permit download; corrupt archives are not overwritten. Unsaved edits are
guarded on page exit, internal navigation and request switching.

Everyday navigation now exposes six employee tasks, including saved requests and
a new bilingual `/help` guide. Specialists, review records, approvals, trends,
evaluation and operations remain accessible in an expandable section. Three
outcome-oriented stages explain the agents; the actual nine-step definition is
available on demand. Errors explain recovery in plain language. Mobile layouts
put saved work ahead of the agent explanation. The enlarged type scale remains.

The interface explicitly identifies saved requests as local, unsubmitted and not
analyzed. No database migration, live FDA ingestion, automated specialist execution,
shared company storage or new access privilege is represented as complete.

Verification: production build/TypeScript, lint and 26 frontend tests passed.
Production-mode Edge checks passed task validation, FDA-link rejection, multiple
draft save/restore/delete, readable export, advanced navigation, nine supporting
routes, Korean/English reflow at 320/390/768/1024/1440px, and mobile Escape/focus.
Separate browser checks passed legacy migration, guarded unsaved clearing, and
download after a storage write failure. No browser JavaScript errors; UI detector
returned no findings. Local evidence: `.artifacts/employee-ux-20260908/` (ignored).

**2026-09-07 Supabase access verified:** The owner supplied project
`wdaflyddglimtijvgazl`. Authenticated CLI project listing and schema queries work.
The project is named `Daewoong FDA`; no application tables were found and the
public schema contains zero tables. A publishable key does not provide backend
runtime credentials. The destination choice (shared database or separate
PharmaAgent OS project) was requested before migrations; no application schema,
data, grants, buckets or Vercel configuration were changed. See
[access verification](docs/assurance/supabase-access-20260907.md).

**2026-09-07 larger interface:** Increased the shared typography scale by roughly
18%, using rem units and a 13px floor for small metadata. Primary body text is
17–19px and workspace headings are 33–40px. Enlarged navigation to 280px, the
header to 76px, primary actions to 46–50px and workflow rows to at least 60px.
The brief editor, navigation icons and template controls also have more room.
Narrow headers, evidence cards and Trends controls reflow at mobile sizes.
Corrected the shared sidebar offset to match the wider navigation.

Verification: production build/TypeScript, lint and all 22 frontend tests passed.
Headless Edge passed the existing complete interaction check (draft lifecycle,
agent search/selection, nine routes, both languages, mobile navigation/focus,
no login and admin denial) without JavaScript errors. Six routes were checked at
320, 390, 768, 1024 and 1440px with no page-level horizontal overflow. Screenshots
and size measurements are in ignored `.artifacts/interface-size-20260907/`;
the typography detector returned no findings. Backend setup remains pending.

**2026-09-07 agent-focused interface redesign:** The service owner requested a
complete interface change emphasizing agentic work. `/dashboard` now presents a
review brief, the actual nine-step workflow definition, selectable specialist
responsibilities and human checkpoints, and accessible case activity. `/agents`
adds searchable descriptions of the five versioned agent definitions. No running
agents, case records, or completion counts are fabricated when the API is absent.
Browser drafts can be saved, restored, deleted and exported as explicitly
unexecuted JSON. These drafts do not create governed cases or submit execution.

The shared navy/light/cobalt theme, PharmaAgent OS identity and grouped navigation
apply across the portal. Cases, approvals, evaluation and operations have shared
bilingual unavailable states with useful routes back to brief preparation.
`/ask` now owns research chat; legacy dashboard query links retain their source
and conversation context. Chat creation/archive invalidate the new route as well.
Account-free viewer authorization and all backend execution/review guards remain.
Korean defaults, English switching, mobile navigation and keyboard focus remain.
Global CSS zoom is removed. Product truth, design rules and UX supersession are
recorded in `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `docs/product/UX_SPEC.md`.

Verification: 22 frontend tests passed; lint and production build/TypeScript passed.
Headless Edge checked draft persistence/isolation/export/deletion, workflow and
agent selection, agent search, nine supporting routes, preserved legacy links,
single-main landmarks, desktop/mobile overflow, mobile navigation/Escape focus,
both languages, no login, and denied admin access. No browser JavaScript errors.
Screenshots and JSON evidence are under ignored
`.artifacts/agent-redesign-20260907/`. The UI detector returned no findings.
Live data, specialist execution and independent evaluation qualification remain
pending; this interface work does not resolve the Supabase/backend blockers.

**2026-09-07 live FDA data incident:** The deployed frontend health returned 200,
but API health returned 500. Vercel web logs also reported missing
`API_SESSION_ISSUER`. Added API session issuer/audience/key ID, matching OIDC
issuer/audience/RS256 configuration, and `SECRET_PROVIDER=vercel` to Production
and Preview. Generated separate 3072-bit RSA keypairs for each environment;
private keys were sent directly to Vercel Secrets, never written to source or logs.
The next deployment applies these settings. Supabase project access, runtime
database URLs, private Storage and remaining production runtime configuration
are still absent. No FDA ingestion or successful live query has been established.
The service owner was asked for the dedicated Supabase project URL; credentials
must be configured through the provider or local ignored environment, not chat.
Login removal remains intact. The full application CI run for `f1767f7` completed
successfully (quality-and-security run `34078404837`).

**2026-09-07 account-free portal:** At the user's request, Google/Naver login,
Auth.js callbacks, and the account/sign-out interface were removed. All visitors
open the dashboard directly; old sign-in links redirect there. An automatic,
signed HttpOnly browser cookie preserves separate chat/saved-view ownership.
Public API assertions carry anonymous UUID subjects and viewer authority; the API
rejects elevated public-session roles, including group-derived permissions.
`PORTAL_SESSION_SECRET` replaces the OAuth settings for the web frontend.
Previous private-account admission requirements below are historical and superseded.
Application commit `f1767f7` is deployed; live desktop/mobile checks confirm direct
dashboard access without login. Obsolete Vercel login settings were removed.
See [public-access evidence](docs/assurance/public-access-20260907.md).

**2026-09-07 GitHub/Vercel publication:** The user authorized publication and
hosting. Checkpoint `8ade4a1` is on GitHub `main`; the dedicated `pharmaagent-os`
Vercel project is connected and its frontend is hosted at
https://pharmaagent-os.vercel.app. The sign-in page and frontend health return 200;
the backend returns 500 because its required production PostgreSQL URL is missing.
Supabase setup, specialist execution, and release qualification remain
outstanding. See [hosting evidence](docs/assurance/github-vercel-hosting-20260907.md).
This supersedes earlier statements that no source push or cloud deployment occurred.

**2026-09-07 continuation — completion boundary:** Before connecting specialist
execution, inspection found that `complete_step` did not validate its declared
output schema or recheck completion-time bindings. The shared service now locks
and refreshes run/invocation/case records, checks active invocation identity and
attempt, plan/state/schema/budget bindings, current approvals, release availability,
and suspension controls. Usage rejects non-finite, negative, coerced, and unknown
values. Exact output contracts currently supported are `RegulatoryFindingList@2.0.0`
and `VerificationReport@1.0.0` (using the existing verification response model).
Other output references fail closed until their adapters and contracts are implemented.
This is structural validation, not proof of retained evidence, independent
verification, or actual specialist execution. The HTTP result path remains a
trusted-caller submission path; fixture outputs cannot qualify production.
See [completion boundary evidence](docs/assurance/completion-boundary-20260907.md).
Final verification: **508 API tests passed, 7 gated integration tests skipped**
in 288.68 seconds. Ruff, contract validation and diff whitespace checks passed.

**Latest audit:** [Launch readiness review](docs/assurance/launch-readiness-20260906.md)
records private-account admission, stricter production startup checks, deployment
preflight/CI repairs, and fresh PostgreSQL/Temporal/restore/container evidence.
Production launch remains blocked by target integration, independently executed
agent/evaluation qualification, and designated release approvals.

**2026-09-06 remediation:** Private deployment templates now use
`AUTH_ADMISSION_MODE=restricted`; populate the immutable-subject role directory
before admitting users. Production rejects SQLite fallback, wildcard Hosts,
unsafe CORS/JWKS/telemetry settings, debug mode, non-RS256 authentication and
plaintext SMTP. CI uses the frozen Python lock and supplies the restore canary's
required timestamp. The latest audit records the full verification scope.
Final verification: **465 packaged API tests passed** with 6 explicitly gated
live-integration skips; the separate PostgreSQL/Temporal set passed all 8 tests.
The web passed 28 tests, lint, TypeScript and production build. Isolated restore,
read-only runtime smoke, contracts and source-secret scans passed; both refreshed
runtime image scans reported zero HIGH/CRITICAL findings. These results establish
local engineering evidence, not target-environment qualification.

**2026-09-07 launch preparation:** The
[launch preparation runbook](docs/runbooks/launch-preparation.md) specifies a
proposed private-pilot sequence, the remaining execution/evaluation adapter work,
hosted acceptance checks, and the owner inputs needed to select the deployment.
The user subsequently selected production on Vercel/Supabase. The
[production runbook](infra/deployment/vercel/README.md) and
[architecture decision](docs/adr/0004-vercel-supabase-production.md) record the
prepared three-service topology, platform secret provider, bounded queue worker,
Supabase Cron/Vault triggers, RLS boundary, and runtime resource packaging.
Dedicated projects/domain and hosted qualification remain outstanding. This does
not complete specialist execution or independent evaluation, and no production
approval or cloud mutation is implied.
Verification: **489 API tests passed, 7 gated integration tests skipped**; the
separate live PostgreSQL boundary/resource set passed all 4 tests. Ruff, contracts,
CI YAML parsing and configuration instance validation passed. See the
[Vercel/Supabase preparation evidence](docs/assurance/vercel-supabase-preparation-20260907.md)
for exact scope and target qualification limits.

**Production-check remediation:** Service/human role separation is now enforced
after group mapping. The Kubernetes base includes missing public-key references,
process-specific model/Temporal settings, API certificate mounts, remote-storage
references and health-probe Host headers. These are local code/template fixes, not
target-cluster qualification; see the latest audit for their verification scope.
Follow-up verification: 39 focused tests passed; the full offline container suite
passed 427 tests with 6 explicitly gated live-integration skips.

All PharmaAgent OS work is contained in this workspace. The earlier FDA project is
separate and must not be used as a working directory for future changes. Git metadata,
local secrets, dependency caches, databases, and build output from that project were
not imported. A dedicated Git repository was initialized during deployment
preparation. GitHub publication and production release are distinct operations.

## Delivered outcome

The existing FDA Product=Drugs evidence platform now includes a case-first agent
operating system with:

- immutable source pins, typed plans, hash-chained case/run events, durable checkpoints,
  human interrupts, and stale-write protection;
- five versioned agents, ten reusable skills, one approved workflow, and sixteen
  deny-by-default tools across three private MCP bundles;
- ACL-before-retrieval synthetic internal knowledge, version history, relationship
  evidence, impact hypotheses, and deterministic review priority;
- independent verification, bounded correction, immutable artifact revisions,
  QA approval, and evidence-bound export;
- multi-trial evaluation, deterministic/model/human grade records, release blocking,
  rollback targets, production feedback, and an Agent Control Tower;
- optional Temporal durability around the bounded LangGraph workflow, exactly-once
  activity journaling, database-queue fallback, kill switches, quotas, workload
  identities, secrets-provider abstraction, OpenTelemetry, backups, and runbooks;
- draft/read-only Email, Slack/Teams, Notion/task, and document-metadata integration,
  plus answer-only A2A interoperability. No agent connector can send or publish.

The product remains decision support. It cannot autonomously create a CAPA, determine
compliance, reject a batch, revise an SOP, or write a controlled quality-system record.

## Database migration order

Run migrations only as the controlled migration owner. Runtime identities must not
have DDL privileges.

1. `20260904_agent_os_control_plane.sql`
2. bootstrap the current SQLAlchemy schema with `fda-intel init-db` for a fresh database
3. `20260904_agent_os_orchestration.sql`
4. `20260904_internal_knowledge_and_impact.sql`
5. `20260904_verification_and_artifacts.sql`
6. `20260904_evaluation_and_control_tower.sql`
7. `20260904_durable_commercial_hardening.sql`
8. `20260904_controlled_integrations.sql`
9. apply `infra/policies/postgres-runtime-roles.sql`

The SQL adds database-enforced immutability, exact case/run/plan/artifact bindings,
one-way review transitions, append-only evaluation/A2A records, and delete guards.
CI runs every script with `psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=1` against PG16 + pgvector.

## Security and integrity invariants

- Identity, case, run, agent, approval, scope, and idempotency context is supplied by
  the trusted host, not model output.
- Production human assertions are short-lived and audience-bound. Service assertions
  use `token_use=service_access`, a `svc:` subject, only the `service` role, and a
  maximum five-minute lifetime.
- Retrieval filters access before ranking or model context. Denied resources do not
  leak titles, metadata, or existence.
- Every tool is deny-by-default, exact-version allowlisted, schema/size/time bounded,
  reauthorized around execution, and attributed to user/case/run/agent.
- A global or exact-agent suspension gates starts, resumes, workers, and MCP calls.
  Updates use optimistic revisions and attributable reasons.
- Tool/activity retries replay only an exact committed input hash. Conflicting reuse
  fails closed and no side effect is duplicated.
- Approved artifacts are immutable. Review is bound to content and evidence-manifest
  hashes; stale writes return conflicts.
- Agent integration records always contain `external_delivery_allowed=false`. The
  platform has no delivery transition or connector credential in this workflow.
- A2A returns case status or approved-artifact metadata only. It cannot invoke tools,
  delegate agents, or perform a controlled write.
- Traces store observable metadata, versions, hashes, metrics, and decisions—not hidden
  chain-of-thought, credentials, or unrestricted source bodies.

## Local operation

### API

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\user\Desktop\PharmaAgentOS\services\api"
uv sync --all-extras --dev
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli init-db
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.cli seed-demo
.\.venv\Scripts\uvicorn.exe app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Portal

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\user\Desktop\PharmaAgentOS\apps\web"
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Optional Temporal and private MCP processes

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\user\Desktop\PharmaAgentOS"
docker compose --env-file infra/local/.env -f infra/local/compose.yaml --profile agent-platform up -d --wait

$env:TEMPORAL_ENABLED = "true"
$env:TEMPORAL_ADDRESS = "127.0.0.1:7233"
services\api\.venv\Scripts\pharma-temporal-worker.exe

services\api\.venv\Scripts\uvicorn.exe app.agent_platform.mcp.server:private_mcp_app --app-dir services/api --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
```

Production requires managed PostgreSQL/pgvector, private versioned object storage,
an approved identity provider, workload identity/AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent,
Temporal mTLS, a private OTEL collector, and reviewed egress routes.

## Verification evidence from this workspace

Latest qualification on 2026-09-05:

- Native API suite with live PostgreSQL and Temporal enabled: **407 passed** in
  352.41 seconds. No integration tests were skipped in this run.
- The subsequent fixture-release guard change passed its focused regression tests.
- Final packaged-runtime evidence and remaining blockers are recorded in the
  [deployment readiness audit](docs/assurance/deployment-readiness-20260905.md).

Earlier baseline checks on 2026-09-04/05 (retained as historical evidence):

- Full API test suite: **400 passed, 5 skipped** in 325.96 seconds.
- The five skips are the explicitly gated live-PostgreSQL tests.
- Post-finalization Control Tower, Approval Center, private MCP, OpenAPI, case-runtime,
  and backup/restore regression set: **18 passed**.
- Regulatory MCP/agent/evaluation focused suite: **71 passed**.
- Final hardening/integration/OpenAPI/restore focused suite: **4 passed**.
- Ruff: `ruff check app tests` — **passed**.
- Web unit tests: **22 passed** across 5 test files.
- Web ESLint with zero warnings: **passed**.
- Web TypeScript check: **passed**.
- Next.js 16 production build: **passed**, including `/approvals`, `/cases`,
  `/cases/[caseId]`, `/evaluations`, and `/control-tower`.
- Contract validator: **passed** — OpenAPI, JSON Schemas, examples, taxonomy,
  12 Agent OS schemas, 6 positive case fixtures, approval freshness, 5 agents,
  10 skills, and 16 deny-by-default tools.
- Kubernetes `kubectl kustomize`: **passed**.
- Docker Compose configuration render: **passed**.
- Local SQLite backup/restore integrity test: **passed**, including control-plane
  schema and a restored canary.

The original test run skipped PostgreSQL because Docker was stopped. The later
deployment audit started Docker, applied all migrations and grants, passed the five
PostgreSQL tests, restored an isolated dump, and exercised live Temporal worker
replacement. See the latest audit for scope and evidence; production mTLS/cluster
disaster recovery remains unqualified.

## Environment-dependent activation still required

The remaining work includes both environment activation and application integration:

1. Review the dedicated Git repository and configure the approved release signing identity.
2. Run the CI PostgreSQL job and retain migration, trigger, grant, and restore evidence.
3. Connect approved corporate IdP/JWKS, workload identities, secret manager, OTEL/SIEM,
   Temporal mTLS, object storage, and egress gateway services.
4. Replace or supplement the compact fictional corpus with a qualified synthetic or
   approved internal dataset. No real Daewoong quality-system data is included.
5. Execute formal security, privacy, QA/CSV, disaster-recovery, and release approvals.
6. Implement independently executed release-grade probabilistic evaluations and
   specialist execution adapters, then approve exact versions before production promotion.

Draft-only connectors deliberately require a human to copy or deliver reviewed
content. Adding automatic Email/Slack/Teams/Notion/task delivery or any controlled
quality-system write would be a new scope requiring explicit action approvals,
reconciliation semantics, threat review, and separate validation.
